    QUIZES
    
1.What is the differnece between signed and an unsign integer?
      signed integer can have both negative and poitive value(most-significan bit, or sign bit, is used to show whether the value is positive or not).
      unsigned integer can have only positive value(sign bit is used to hold a "number", not "sign")
      
2.Why should you not use #define to declare a constant?
      Compiler doesn't know the type of the constant when we use #define.
      
3.Why would you initialize a variable?
      Because variables are created to store values, which will be used/changed during the execution of the program.
      
4. Consider the enum below. What is the value of Queen?
   enum YourCards {Ace, Jack, Queen, King};
        Value of the Queen is 2.
        
5. What is wrong with this variable name?
      int Integer = 0;
      
      'Integer' is a keyword, so it can't be a variable name.
      
      
      
    EXERCISES
    
1. Modify enum YourCards in quiz question 4 to demonstrate that the value of
   Queen can be 45.
      
      enum YourCards{Ace = 43, Jack, Queen, King};
      
2. Write a program that demonstrates that the size of an unsigned integer and a normal
   integer are the same, and that both are smaller in size than a long integer.
   
   #include<iostream>
   int main()
   {
      std::cout << "Size of a signed int is " << sizeof(int) << std::endl;
      std::cout << "Size of an unsigned int is " << sizeof(unsigned int) << std::endl;
      std::cout << "Size of long is " << sizeof(long) << std::endl;
      return 0;
   }
   
 3. Write a program to calculate the area and circumference of a circle where the
    radius is fed by the user.
    
    #include<iostream>
    int main()
    {
        const float pi = 22 / 7;
        float radius;
        std::cin >> radius;
        double area;
        area = pi * radius * radius;
        circumference = 2 * pi * radius;
        std::cout << area << ' ' << circumference << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
   
 4. In Exercise 3, if the area and circumference were to be stored in integers, how
    would the output be any different?
        
        Numbers would be rounded down.(5.7 -> 5)
        
 5.BUGBUSTERS: What is wrong in the following initialization:
   auto Integer;
      
        Integer is a keyword, can't be a variable name.
