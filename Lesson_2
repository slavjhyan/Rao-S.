QUIZES

    1. What is the problem in declaring Int main()?
              C++ is a case sensitive language, Int must be written as int.
              
    2. Can comments be longer than one line?
              If they are written between /* and */
              
              
 EXERCISES
 
   1. BUG BUSTERS: Enter this program and compile it. Why does it fail? How can
you fix it?

Before:
1: #include <iostream>
2: void main()
3: {
4: std::Cout << Is there a bug here?";
5: }

After:
1: #include <iostream>
2: int main()
3: {
4:      std::cout << "Is there a bug here?";
        return 0;
5: }
   2. Fix the bug in Exercise 1 and recompile, link, and run it.
        Outputs: Is there a bug here? 
        
   3. Modify Listing 2.4 to demonstrate subtraction (using â€“) and multiplication (using *).
   
 1: #include <iostream>
 2: using namespace std;
 3:
 4: // Declare a function
 5: int DemoConsoleOutput();
 6:
 7: int main()
 8: {
 9: // Call i.e. invoke the function
10: DemoConsoleOutput();
11:
12: return 0;
13: }
14:
15: // Define i.e. implement the previously declared function
16: int DemoConsoleOutput()
17: {
18: cout << "This is a simple string literal" << endl;
19: cout << "Writing number five: " << 5 << endl;
20: cout << "Performing multiplication 10 * 5 = " << 10 * 5 << endl;
21: cout << "Performing subtration 22 - 7 = " << 22 - 7 << endl;
23:
24: return 0;
25: }
